            <h1>My Art Work</h1>
            <p>As a hobby I also enjoy drawing and painting. I love to capture moments of interaction between people and with nature
                through watercolors graphite and mixed media. I want to capture a sense of tranquility and community which I apply to
                my architectural ideas.</p>
